A production-grade **End-to-End Testing and Observability Framework** combining:

* **Playwright** (Automated E2E Testing)
* **Prometheus** (Metrics Scraping)
* **Grafana** (Dashboard Visualization + Alerts)
* **Loki + Promtail** (Log Aggregation)

Built for scalability, clarity, and real-world CI/CD pipelines.

# üìà Why This Project?

* **Automation First:** Robust E2E UI/API testing with Playwright
* **Observability Live:** Real-time metrics and logs capture with Prometheus, Loki, and Grafana
* **CI/CD Integrated:** GitHub Actions automates testing and artifact publishing

# üìä Reporting and Observability

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Test Reports

* **Playwright HTML Report**
* **Playwright JSON Report**

### üî¢ Metrics Observability

* **Total Tests** (`playwright_total_tests`)
* **Passed Tests** (`playwright_passed_tests`)
* **Failed Tests** (`playwright_failed_tests`)

### üîç Log Observability

* **Playwright Test Logs** are streamed via Promtail to Loki
* Structured log fields: `status`, `suite`, `title`, `tags[]`, `project`, `duration`
* All logs and metrics visualized in **Grafana Dashboards**

---

# üè∑Ô∏è Tagging Strategy

Playwright tests use `@tag` annotations to organize and filter tests across CI, logs, and dashboards. Tags are extracted from both `test.describe()` and `test()` titles via a custom wrapper and included in structured logs.

### üìö Tag Categories

| Category     | Examples                         | Purpose                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Type         | `@smoke`, `@regression`          | Run groups for CI jobs             |
| Feature Area | `@login`, `@search`, `@cart`     | Feature scope and filtering        |
| Behavior     | `@flaky`, `@slow`, `@quarantine` | Stability and execution visibility |
| Platform     | `@mobile`, `@firefox`            | Environment-specific logic         |
| Priority     | `@critical`, `@normal`           | Risk-based test grouping           |

### ‚úÖ Tagging Guidelines

* Every test should have at least one meaningful tag
* Tags must start with `@` and use lowercase with dashes or underscores
* Suite-level tags are inherited by all child tests
* Do **not** tag implementation details (e.g., `@uses-middleware`)

### üîç Usage Examples

```ts
test.describe('@smoke @cart Cart Feature', () => {
  test('@slow adds item to cart', async () => {
    // This test gets: ["@smoke", "@cart", "@slow"]
  });
});
```

Tags appear in both logs (for Loki) and annotations (for filtering or metrics).

# ‚öñÔ∏è Test Coverage

* **UI Flows:**

  * Add Todo
  * Toggle Todo
  * Delete Todo
  * Filter Todos
  * Navigate via URL hash (All, Active, Completed)
* **API Health Checks:**

  * Example or mock API routes if applicable (optional)

# ‚öôÔ∏è Running the Framework

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run all Playwright tests

```bash
npm run test
```

3. Run Playwright tests with different options:

* Debug mode:

```bash
npm run test:debug
```

* Smoke tests:

```bash
npm run test:smoke
```

* Regression tests:

```bash
npm run test:regression
```

* API tests:

```bash
npm run test:api
```

* Run Playwright tests for a specific browser:

```bash
npm run test:chromium
npm run test:firefox
npm run test:webkit
```

4. Clean and re-run tests

```bash
npm run test:clean
```

5. Start Metrics Server

```bash
npm run start:metrics-server
```

6. Start Observability Stack (Loki + Promtail)

```bash
cd observability

docker-compose -f docker-compose.loki.yml up -d
```

7. Access Grafana

```plaintext
http://localhost:3000
```

# üåü Future Enhancements

* Slack/Email Alerts integration in Grafana
* Advanced log filtering for test debugging
* Full Kubernetes deployment support
* Cloud Grafana dashboards for remote observability
