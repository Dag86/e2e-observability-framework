# 📋 E2E Observability Testing Strategy

A structured strategy for ensuring scalable, maintainable, and observable end-to-end test automation using Playwright (TypeScript).

---

## 🛠️ Objective

- Validate critical user workflows via E2E automation.
- Detect functional regressions quickly during development and release cycles.
- Maintain clean, modular, and scalable test architecture.
- Enable reporting and observability for continuous integration and operational feedback loops.

---

## 🧪 Test Types and Scope

| Test Type | Purpose | Examples |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Smoke Tests | Verify that core functionality is operational. | Create todo, complete todo |
| Regression Tests | Validate critical edge cases and negative scenarios. | Delete todo item |

✅ Focus is on critical path coverage first, then iterative expansion.

---

## 📚 Test Data Strategy

- Test data is centralized inside `src/constants/test-data.ts`.
- Structured using simple reusable object patterns.
- Data-driven tests are implemented where necessary to validate variations without duplicating code.

Example:

```typescript
export const TestData = {
  todoItem: {
    basic: 'Wash the car',
    second: 'Buy groceries',
    specialChars: '!@#$%^&*()_+',
    longText: 'A very long todo item to test UI wrapping behavior...'
  }
};
```

---

## 🎯 Selector Strategy

- All UI element selectors are centralized in `src/constants/selectors.ts`.
- Preference order for selectors:
  1. `data-testid` attributes (preferred and stable)
  2. Accessibility attributes (e.g., `aria-label`)
  3. Semantic element tags only if necessary
- Xpath is avoided unless absolutely required.

✅ This ensures that changes to UI structure impact only one location.

---

## 🏗️ Page Object Model (POM)

- Page Objects are used to encapsulate page-specific behaviors and actions.
- Located inside `src/pages/`, currently managing:
  - Navigation
  - Todo creation
  - Todo completion

✅ Keeps test scripts clean and focused on logic, not low-level DOM details.

---

## ⚙️ Test Execution Strategy

- Playwright test runner (`@playwright/test`) handles all execution.
- Tests are organized into logical suites under:
  - `src/tests/smoke/`
  - `src/tests/regression/`
- Browser projects are defined in `playwright.config.ts`:
  - Chromium
  - Firefox
  - WebKit

✅ Allows for cross-browser validation from the start.

---

## 🚀 CI/CD Integration Strategy (Planned)

- Ready for GitHub Actions integration under `.github/workflows/run-tests.yml`.
- Reporting configured for:
  - HTML reports
  - JSON reports (future observability integrations like Prometheus/Grafana)

✅ Ensures tests can run automatically on PRs and deployments in the future.

---

## 📈 Reporting Strategy

- HTML report generated per test run under `/reports/playwright-reports/`.
- JSON report generated under `/reports/json-reports/` for potential future pipeline integrations.
- Command to open the latest report:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

✅ Enables both visual and programmatic result analysis.

---

## 🛠️ Maintenance Strategy

- New selectors must be added to `selectors.ts`.
- New data must be added to `test-data.ts`.
- New pages must be added to `pages/` using the POM pattern.
- Every test must use clean and descriptive tags (`@smoke`, `@regression`, etc.).

✅ Keeps the framework modular, extensible, and easy to audit.

---

## 🧠 Future Expansion Plans

- Add API testing layer using Playwright's `request` context.
- Implement test parallelization and sharding across multiple runners.
- Capture and visualize test execution trends with Grafana dashboards.
- Add flakiness detection and quarantine workflows for unstable tests.
